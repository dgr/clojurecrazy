I have been programming more than 40 years. The other day, I got a bit
depressed thinking about the rise of "coding" versus traditional
computer science. As software eats the world, there has been a growing
demand for people that can create it, and along with that demand a
surge in training to create those skills. Overall, this demand is a
good thing for the profession; it turns out that computers really are
universal machines and they're really useful. But it feels like this
has resulted in a bunch of "learn to code" mills that churn out
barely-adequate coders, as opposed to quality software engineers who
actually understand computer science. Note that I'm not suggesting
that everybody must go through a traditional university CompSci
program; indeed, I have known some great software engineers who either
dropped out of college or were informally trained. I'm more concerned
about the end-result: coders who graduated from "Learn JavaScript in
21 days! Your path to riches!" programs and who don't understand
algorithmic complexity and can't explain race conditions but who can
string together a bunch of libraries downloaded from a package
archive. Compare that to software engineers who actually know how to
create quality designs that have strong theoretical underpinnings. To
put it another way, the more software we need, the more mediocre
coders we churn out, and the more buggy, unstable, and insecure the
world gets. Is it just me thinking about this?
